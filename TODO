TODO:
- messages should be nodes
- use theme to make everything customizeable
- get rid of javascript
- sort messages per author/date/ecc
- mix with mail (receive a mail in your mailbox, get a mail when you have a new message, answer by email)
- option to have every message sent in a central box even from other sites
- integrate with (coming) buddy api: show list of recipient near to: field, ignore list
- some sort of folder, received, sent, move messages between folders; use taxonomy for these? personal taxonomy would be perfect
- help and info

doubts:
- is author to index?
- preview message before sending(?)
- watchdog(?)
- change links (write new, reply, delete, etc) to form buttons?
- admin with message search?
- "outbox" as sent folder? is "outbox" english?

other ideas:
- integration with jabber(?)
- filters
