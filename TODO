TODO:
- sort messages per author/date/ecc
- help and info

doubts:
- is author to index?
- preview message before sending(?)
- watchdog(?)
- change links (write new, reply, delete, etc) to form buttons?
- admin with message search?
- "outbox" as sent folder? is "outbox" english?

other ideas:
- some sort of folder, received, sent, move messages between folders
- message from user pages
- option to forward a message to your email (and be able to answer by mail too?)
- integration with jabber(?)
- filters, ignore user
- what about users on other servers? distribute messages between servers? (seems jabber work though)
